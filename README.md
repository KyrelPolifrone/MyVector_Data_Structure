# MyVector_Data_Structure
These files act as a data structure which allows for adding generic types into an array. There are numerous methods associated with the vector.

These codes were tested in Intellij Java 11.0.3. The codes allow for the creation of a data structure which accepts any form of generic type and can store the elements in an array. The array, also often referred to as vector since it is 1 dimensional, has numberous operations that can be performed on it.

Files:
MyAbstractList contains a few methods which are used in the MyVector file.
MyList is an interface containing all the methods that were necessary to make the data structure operate as intended.
MyVector contains the code for the methods as well as descriptions for each method.
